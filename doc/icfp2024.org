* An Implementation of a Visual Stepper in the GRASP programming system

GRASP is a nascent graphical development environment
for the Scheme programming language, consisting of
a structural editor for S-expressions, as well as
an extension mechanism, which allows to display various
forms of data in an arbitrary visual way.

This paper presents an implementation of one such
extension, namely -- a visual stepper, which allows
to observe single step reductions of a purely
functional subset of Scheme.

GRASP is currently available as a desktop appication,
a terminal applcation and an Android application.
It is implemented in Kawa, which is a dialect
of Scheme that runs on the JVM and provides
extensions for interfacing with JVM classes
and libraries.
